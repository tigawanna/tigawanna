# Priority Soft - Full-Stack Developer Assessment

## Project: ShiftSync — Multi-Location Staff Scheduling Platform

---

## Overview

Build a web-based shift scheduling platform for a fictional restaurant group ("Coastal Eats") that operates **4 locations** across **2 time zones**. The platform must handle the inherent complexity of real-world workforce scheduling while remaining intuitive for both managers and staff.

---

## Business Context

Coastal Eats struggles with:

- Staff frequently calling out with no coverage
- Overtime costs spiraling due to poor visibility
- Employees complaining about unfair shift distribution
- Managers at different locations hoarding "good" employees
- No central view of who's working where and when

Your solution must address these pain points.

---

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. User Management & Roles

**Three user types exist:**

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Corporate oversight across all locations |
| **Manager** | Runs one or more specific locations |
| **Staff** | Works shifts at one or more locations |
- Staff members can be certified to work at multiple locations
- Staff have **skills** (e.g., "bartender", "line cook", "server", "host")
- Staff have **availability windows** they set themselves (recurring weekly + one-off exceptions)
- Managers can only see/manage locations they're assigned to
- Admins see everything

---

### 2. Shift Scheduling

**Managers must be able to:**

- Create shifts with: location, date/time, required skill, and headcount needed
- Assign specific staff to shifts manually
- Publish a week's schedule (making it visible to staff)
- Unpublish/edit a schedule before a configurable cutoff (default: 48 hours before the shift)

**The system must enforce:**

- No double-booking (same person, overlapping times, even across locations)
- Minimum **10 hours** between the end of one shift and start of another for the same person
- Staff can only be assigned to shifts requiring skills they possess
- Staff can only be assigned to locations they're certified for
- Staff can only be assigned during their available hours

**When a constraint is violated:**

- The system must **clearly explain which rule was broken and why**
- The system should **suggest alternatives** when possible (e.g., "Sarah is unavailable, but John and Maria have the required skill and availability")

---

### 3. Shift Swapping & Coverage

**Staff can:**

- Request to swap a shift with another qualified staff member
- Offer a shift up for grabs ("drop request")
- Pick up available shifts they're qualified for

**Swap/coverage workflow:**

1. Staff A requests swap or drop
2. If swap: Staff B must accept
3. Manager must approve the final change
4. All parties are notified at each step
5. Original assignment remains until manager approval

**Edge case requirements:**

- If a swap is pending and the manager edits that shift, the swap request should be automatically cancelled with notification
- A staff member cannot have more than **3 pending swap/drop requests** at once
- Drop requests expire **24 hours** before the shift starts if unclaimed

---

### 4. Overtime & Labor Law Compliance

**The system must track and warn about:**

- Weekly hours approaching **40 hours** (warning at 35+)
- Daily hours exceeding **8 hours** (warning) or **12 hours** (hard block)
- **6th consecutive day** worked in a week (warning)
- **7th consecutive day** worked in a week (requires manager override with documented reason)

**Overtime visualization:**

- Dashboard showing projected overtime costs for the week
- Highlighting which specific assignments are pushing staff into overtime
- Ability to see "what-if" impact before confirming an assignment

---

### 5. Schedule Fairness Analytics

**The system must provide:**

- Distribution report showing hours assigned per staff member over a selected period
- "Desirable shift" tracking — shifts on Friday/Saturday evenings are tagged as premium
- Fairness score showing whether premium shifts are distributed equitably
- Managers can see which staff members have been under/over-scheduled relative to their stated desired hours

---

### 6. Real-Time Features

- When a manager publishes or modifies a schedule, affected staff should see updates **without refreshing**
- When a swap request is submitted or resolved, relevant parties should be notified **in real-time**
- An "on-duty now" dashboard showing who is currently clocked into a shift at each location, updating live
- If two managers try to assign the same staff member simultaneously, one should see a conflict notification immediately

---

### 7. Notifications & Communication

- Staff receive notifications for: new shifts assigned, shift changes, swap request updates, schedule published
- Managers receive notifications for: swap/drop requests needing approval, overtime warnings, staff availability changes
- Users configure their notification preferences (in-app only, or in-app + email simulation)
- All notifications are persisted and viewable in a notification center with read/unread status

---

### 8. Calendar & Time Handling

- All times must be stored and processed correctly regardless of user timezone
- Users see times displayed **in the location's timezone** for that shift
- Recurring availability must handle daylight saving time transitions correctly
- A shift starting at 11pm and ending at 3am must be handled as a single shift (overnight)

---

### 9. Audit Trail

- All schedule changes must be logged: who made the change, when, what the before/after state was
- Managers can view the history of any shift
- Admins can export audit logs for any date range and location

---

## Evaluation Scenarios

The evaluator will test your system with these scenarios (among others):

1. **The Sunday Night Chaos**: A staff member calls out at 6pm Sunday for a 7pm shift. Walk through the fastest path to finding coverage.
2. **The Overtime Trap**: A manager tries to build a schedule where they don't realize one employee would hit 52 hours. How does the system help?
3. **The Timezone Tangle**: A staff member is certified at a location in Pacific time and another in Eastern time. They set availability as "9am-5pm". What happens?
4. **The Simultaneous Assignment**: Two managers both try to assign the same bartender to different locations at the same time. What happens?
5. **The Fairness Complaint**: An employee claims they never get Saturday night shifts. How does a manager verify or refute this?
6. **The Regret Swap**: Staff A and B request a swap. The manager hasn't approved it yet. Staff A changes their mind. What are the implications?

---

## Deliverables

1. **Working Application** — Deployed to a publicly accessible URL
2. **Source Code** — Public GitHub Repository with commit history
3. **Seed Data** — Pre-populated with realistic test data covering edge cases (multiple locations, staff with various skills, existing schedule with some conflicts)
4. **Brief Documentation** — How to log in as each role, any known limitations, and any assumptions you made where requirements were ambiguous
5. This should be sent to your hiring managers email before/at the time of the 72 hour deadline

## Intentional Ambiguities

The following are **deliberately unspecified**. Part of the evaluation is how you choose to handle them:

- What happens to historical data when a staff member is de-certified from a location?
- How should "desired hours" interact with availability windows?
- When calculating consecutive days, does a 1-hour shift count the same as an 11-hour shift?
- If a shift is edited after swap approval but before it occurs, what should happen?
- How should the system handle a location that spans a timezone boundary (e.g., a restaurant near a state line)?

### Decisions

**De-certification does not rewrite history.** Removing a staff location cert (`user_location`) leaves `shift` and `shift_assignment` rows in place. The staff calendar only shows assignments at locations they are still certified for. Managers cannot assign them at that location again (skill + cert check). Published weeks at a dropped location leave their calendar. This keeps payroll/history intact without a soft-delete or archive table.

**A 1-hour shift counts as a worked day.** Consecutive-day warnings and the 7th-day override use distinct civil dates in the **location** week (Monday–Sunday). Any assigned time on that date counts, including a 1-hour shift. Overnight hours that land on a date in that week count for that date.

**Empty weekly availability is open.** Recurring windows are optional. If a staff member has no weekly windows, they are treated as available except where a blocked exception applies. Extra exceptions still add time on top of weekly windows.

**40h is over the weekly limit, not a hard assign block.** Assign still goes through after a confirmation. Daily hours hard-block above 12h on a civil date in the location timezone.

**Daily hours are bucketed in the clock of the location being assigned.** Someone can hold shifts in two zones on the same civil date. Every interval — including shifts at other locations — is split onto civil dates using the timezone of the shift being assigned, so "12h on 2026-08-17" always means a Harbor House day when you are assigning at Harbor House. Bucketing each site in its own zone was tried and rejected: it merges two different civil-day frames onto one date key, so the total stops describing any real day. Weekly hours use the same single frame (the location week), and they sum every location.

**One gate for putting someone on a shift.** Manager assign, coverage approval, and a shift edit that moves times or changes the required skill all run the same check (`assertAssignable`): skill, cert, overlap, 10h rest, availability, daily and weekly hours, consecutive days. Approving a pickup is an assignment, so it can fail with the same named rule — a manager who wants it anyway removes the blocker or assigns by hand. An edit that would strand a current assignee is rejected and names the person and the rule rather than silently leaving an illegal assignment.

**Desired hours are a weekly target, not a filter on availability.** Availability is when someone can be assigned. Desired hours is how many hours they want in that Monday–Sunday week. An unset week has no target. Fairness later compares scheduled hours to this number; it does not change assign eligibility.

**Overtime cost is projected at $22/h × 1.5 for hours over 40.** Weekly hours for OT include assignments at every location (the multi-site trap). The location-week report roster is people assigned at that location that week.

**Premium is Friday or Saturday, location-local start at 16:00 or later.** Fairness is 100 when premium counts are even (or nobody has any) and drops when a few people hold most of them.

**On duty now is a 15-second refetch** of assignments whose shift interval contains the current instant. Managers see their locations; admins see every location. Times are in the location timezone.

**Schedule writes append an audit row** (actor, time, action, JSON before/after). Deleting a shift keeps the log (`shift_id` is not a foreign key). Admin export uses Coastal Eats HQ civil dates (`America/Los_Angeles`).

**Live views are driven by a 4-second pulse.** One small server function returns four aggregates (latest shift write, latest assignment, latest coverage change, latest publish) plus the viewer's unread count. The dashboard polls that and invalidates the heavy queries only when the value moves; those queries keep a 30-second interval as a safety net, and "on duty now" stays on its own 15-second timer because it turns over with the clock rather than with a write. Assign re-checks overlapping shifts inside a write transaction so two managers cannot both land the same person in an overlap, and every coverage state change is a conditional update, so a second claimer or approver is told the request already moved instead of overwriting it.

**Notifications are in-app rows** (unread until opened). Optional “simulate email” stores a flag on the row. Events include publish, assign, shift edit, coverage steps, edit-cancels-pending, overtime, and availability exceptions.

**An approved swap already moved the assignment.** Editing that shift later is a normal shift edit (48-hour cutoff still applies). The current assignee stays; pending (not-yet-approved) swap/drop rows on that shift are cancelled and the parties are notified. The approved request is not unwound.

**A location has one IANA timezone.** Shifts, availability matching, overnight splits, and weekly hours use that stored zone — not the staff browser and not a second zone for a nearby state. If a restaurant sat on a state line, pick the zone Coastal Eats operates in and put it on the location row.
