1. React for front end
2. GrapQl on Nodejs and apollo/react-query as the client
3. Redis for cache
4. Firebase, Postgress and MongoDb for dbs
5. Tailwind css for styling

>just to mention a few. I have worked on a few projects so far that include the use of technologies such as 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and some kotlin .


Am currently:
