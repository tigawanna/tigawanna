## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dennis Kinuthia. I am an aspiring _web developer_. I love working with Javascript with libraries like 

1. React for front end
2. GraphQl on Nodejs and apollo/react-query as the client
3. Redis for cache
4. Firebase, Postgress and MongoDb for dbs
5. Tailwind css for styling

> just to mention a few. I have worked on a few projects so far that include the use of technologies such as 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and some kotlin .
